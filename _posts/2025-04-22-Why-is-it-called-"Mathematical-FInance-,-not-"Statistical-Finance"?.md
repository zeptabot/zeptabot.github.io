## Why is it called "Mathematical FInance", not "Statistical Finance"?

People seem to be saying that Statistics is more relevant to Quant Finance than Mathematics. The quantitative tools in quant finance seem to be based more on upper-year Stat topics (Stochastic process, Multivariate analysis, Time Series Analysis, Probability, Machine Learning) as opposed to upper-year maths (group theory, real analysis, topology). Except for ODE and PDE, which is not used as often then when this occupation first became a thing nowadays anyway.

Dimitri Bianco, the famous quant YouTuber, also said that the best degree for a career in quant finance besides a quant master and a STEM PhD is a Statistics degree.

The similar jobs that are often compared with quants are data scientists (vs quant researchers) and actuaries (vs risk quants), which are obviously more stats-oriented than math-oriented.

So why are most programs still called "Mathematical Finance", not "Statistical Finance"? And why do people still have the impression that quant is a "math" career, not a "stats" career?

### Key Points
- Research suggests "Mathematical Finance" is used due to historical roots in math, broader scope, and prestige, though statistics is increasingly vital.
- It seems likely that the name persists because early models like Black-Scholes relied on math, and "Mathematical Finance" signals rigor.
- The evidence leans toward statistics being more relevant today, with tools like machine learning and time series analysis, but math remains foundational.

### Why the Name "Mathematical Finance"?
The field is called "Mathematical Finance" because it originated from mathematical models in the 1970s, like the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which used stochastic calculus and partial differential equations (PDEs). These are seen as "mathematical" tools, even though they involve probability. The name also reflects a broader scope, covering both math and statistics, and carries academic prestige, making it appealing for programs and careers.

### Why the "Math" Career Perception?
People still see quant finance as a "math" career due to its historical focus on mathematical rigor and the perception of quants as analytical problem-solvers. While statistics is crucial today, the field's roots and the use of advanced math in areas like derivatives pricing reinforce this view.

### Statistics vs. Mathematics in Quant Finance
Today, statistics seems more relevant with tools like stochastic processes, time series analysis, and machine learning, as noted by experts like Dimitri Bianco, who recommends a Statistics degree for quant careers. However, mathematics, especially PDEs and optimization, remains foundational for certain tasks, so both are essential.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of "Mathematical Finance" vs. "Statistical Finance"

This analysis explores why the field is called "Mathematical Finance" rather than "Statistical Finance," despite the increasing relevance of statistics in quantitative finance, and why it is often perceived as a "math" career. The investigation considers historical origins, practical scope, perception, and the evolution of the field, drawing on academic and industry insights.

#### Historical Origins and Naming Conventions

Quantitative finance emerged in the 1970s with landmark models like the Black-Scholes model for option pricing, which relied heavily on **stochastic calculus**, **partial differential equations (PDEs)**, and **probability theory**. These tools were rooted in mathematics, particularly applied mathematics, and were central to early developments in pricing financial instruments and managing risk. The term "Mathematical Finance" was adopted to reflect this emphasis on theoretical rigor and analytical solutions, as seen in academic programs and research at the time.

For example, the Black-Scholes model, introduced in 1973, used PDEs to derive a closed-form solution for option prices, solidifying the field's mathematical identity. This historical foundation explains why programs and textbooks, such as "Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives" by John Hull ([Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Options%2C+Futures%2C+and+Other+Derivatives%2C+11th+Edition-p-9781119603691)), are often titled under "Mathematical Finance." The name has persisted due to academic inertia and tradition, even as the field evolved.

#### Broader Scope and Interdisciplinary Nature

"Mathematical Finance" encompasses a wider range of quantitative methods beyond statistics, including:
- **Pure mathematics**: Calculus, optimization, differential equations, and even abstract algebra (though less common).
- **Probability and statistics**: Stochastic processes, time series analysis, and statistical modeling.
- **Computational methods**: Numerical analysis, simulation techniques, and algorithmic trading.

In contrast, "Statistical Finance" might imply a narrower focus on data-driven statistical methods, such as regression analysis or hypothesis testing, which does not fully capture the field's interdisciplinary nature. For instance, while stochastic processes (a statistical concept) are crucial for modeling financial markets, tools like PDEs (used in option pricing) and optimization (used in portfolio management) are more "mathematical" in nature. This broader scope justifies the use of "Mathematical Finance" in program names, as seen in offerings at institutions like MIT ([MIT Mathematical Finance](https://math.mit.edu/academics/grad/finance)) and Stanford ([Stanford Financial Mathematics](https://scpd.stanford.edu/public/category/courseCategoryCertificateProfile.do?method=load&certificateId=1586820)).

#### Perception and Prestige

The term "mathematics" carries significant academic and intellectual prestige, often seen as the "queen of sciences" in academic circles. This perception aligns with the image of quants as highly analytical, problem-solving experts, which is reinforced by the field's historical association with advanced mathematical tools. In contrast, "statistics" might be perceived as more applied or data-driven, potentially understating the theoretical depth required for quant finance. This cultural distinction influences how the field is branded, with "Mathematical Finance" signaling rigor and attracting top talent.

For example, many top graduate programs in quant finance emphasize mathematical training, and a PhD in mathematics or applied math can lead to a quant career, further reinforcing the "math" association. This perception is also evident in industry, where quants are often described as "math whizzes" in popular media and job descriptions, as seen in discussions on platforms like QuantStackExchange ([Why is it called Mathematical Finance?](https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/1398/why-is-it-called-mathematical-finance)).

#### Evolution of the Field and Statistical Relevance

While early quantitative finance was heavily mathematical, the field has evolved to incorporate more statistical and data-driven techniques, especially with the rise of **big data**, **machine learning**, and **computational finance**. Modern quants often use tools like:
- **Stochastic processes** (e.g., Brownian motion, Markov chains)
- **Time series analysis** (e.g., ARIMA, GARCH models)
- **Machine learning** (e.g., neural networks for prediction)
- **Multivariate statistics** (e.g., for portfolio optimization)

These tools are more statistical in nature, and research suggests that statistics is increasingly vital for quant finance. For instance, Dimitri Bianco, a prominent quant YouTuber, recommends a Statistics degree as one of the best for a quant career besides a quant master's or STEM PhD, highlighting its relevance for understanding financial markets ([Dimitri Bianco's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DimitriBianco)). Upper-year statistics topics (e.g., stochastic processes, multivariate analysis, time series analysis, probability, machine learning) are more commonly used than upper-year math topics like group theory, real analysis, or topology, except for ODEs and PDEs, which are less prevalent today than in the field's early days.

#### Comparison to Related Fields

- **Data scientists** focus on extracting insights from data using statistical and machine learning techniques, overlapping with quant researchers in areas like predictive modeling.
- **Actuaries** use statistics heavily for risk assessment and insurance pricing, similar to risk quants in financial institutions.

However, quants often need to go beyond data analysis to build **mathematical models** of financial systems. For example, a quant might derive a closed-form solution for an exotic option using PDEs (a mathematical task), while a data scientist might focus on training a machine learning model to predict stock prices (a statistical task). This dual nature explains why both math and stats are essential, but the "mathematical" label persists due to the field's historical and theoretical foundations.

#### Practical Considerations for Program Naming

Many "Mathematical Finance" programs do include significant statistical content, with courses on stochastic processes, time series analysis, and statistical inference being common. For example, a typical curriculum might include:
- **Mathematics**: Stochastic calculus, numerical methods, optimization.
- **Statistics**: Time series analysis, regression, machine learning.
- **Computer Science**: Algorithm design, computational finance.

Renaming programs to "Statistical Finance" might not fully capture this interdisciplinary approach, and given the standardized use of "Mathematical Finance" in academia and industry, it remains the preferred term for clarity and recognition. This is evident in program listings at universities like Columbia ([Columbia Mathematical Finance](https://www.math.columbia.edu/programs/mathematical-finance)) and NYU ([NYU Courant Mathematical Finance](https://math.nyu.edu/degree/phd-mathematical-finance)).

#### Conclusion

The name "Mathematical Finance" reflects the field's historical roots in mathematical modeling, its broader scope beyond statistics, and the prestige associated with mathematics. While statistics is increasingly vital, especially with modern tools like machine learning and time series analysis, the "math" label persists due to tradition and perception. As a first-year student, focusing on both mathematics and statistics, particularly in areas like stochastic processes and machine learning, will prepare you well for a quant career.
