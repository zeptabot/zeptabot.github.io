# **A Comparative Analysis of Full-Body and Upper/Lower Split Routines for Strength, Hypertrophy, and Adherence in Trained Males**

## **The Primacy of Training Volume: The Foundational Variable in Program Design**

The discourse surrounding optimal resistance training (RT) program design is frequently centered on the comparison of different training splits, such as full-body (FB) versus upper/lower (U/L) routines. However, before delving into the nuances of how training is organized across the week, it is imperative to establish the foundational principle that governs muscular adaptation: training volume. An extensive body of scientific literature demonstrates that total weekly training volume is the most critical and potent variable for driving gains in both muscle hypertrophy and strength. Understanding this principle reframes the debate from a simplistic question of "which split is better?" to a more sophisticated analysis of "which split best facilitates the accrual of, and recovery from, optimal weekly training volume?"

### **1.1 The Overarching Principle: Weekly Volume as the Key Driver of Hypertrophy and Strength**

The most consistent finding from decades of resistance training research is the powerful relationship between the volume of work performed and the resultant physiological adaptations. Numerous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have converged on a clear conclusion: when total weekly training volume is equated between different training frequencies or split routines, the specific organizational strategy has a minimal, often statistically non-significant, impact on outcomes for both muscle growth and strength development.1 This robust evidence base establishes volume as the hierarchical apex of programming variables.

For muscle hypertrophy, the evidence points toward a clear dose-response relationship, where greater weekly training volumes produce greater increases in muscle mass, at least up to a certain threshold.9 A 2017 meta-analysis by Schoenfeld, Ogborn, and Krieger demonstrated this graded relationship, finding that each additional weekly set was associated with a greater hypertrophic effect size.12 Subsequent research has sought to define an optimal volume range for experienced lifters. A 2022 meta-analysis focusing on trained men concluded that a weekly volume of 12-20 sets per muscle group may represent an optimum standard recommendation for maximizing muscle growth.9 This suggests that while some volume is good, more is generally better, until recovery capacity is exceeded.

The dose-response relationship between volume and muscular strength, while also positive, appears to be different. A 2024 meta-regression by Pelland and colleagues found that while strength gains do increase with volume, they exhibit more pronounced diminishing returns compared to hypertrophy.13 This means that after a certain number of weekly sets, the additional strength gained per set decreases significantly. This phenomenon is logical when considering the nature of strength adaptation, which is a composite of both morphological changes (hypertrophy) and significant neuromuscular factors, including motor unit recruitment, rate coding, and inter-muscular coordination.14 While more muscle mass provides a higher potential for force production, perfecting the skill of strength expression does not require the same endless increase in volume that may continue to drive small amounts of hypertrophy.

This understanding fundamentally shifts the nature of the inquiry. If total weekly volume is the primary determinant of results, then the comparison between a 3-day FB routine and a 4-day U/L split is not about an intrinsic superiority of one frequency over the other. Rather, the more salient question is which organizational structure best allows a trained individual to consistently perform and, crucially, recover from their optimal weekly volume. The choice of split becomes a strategic tool for volume management. A 4-day U/L split, for instance, may allow for a greater total weekly volume per muscle group simply because each session is more focused, enabling the inclusion of more exercises and sets for the targeted muscles.15 Conversely, a 3-day FB routine might enhance the

*quality* of a given volume by distributing the stress more evenly throughout the week, which may attenuate the accumulated intra-session fatigue that can degrade performance in longer, more concentrated workouts.5 The debate, therefore, is not about frequency for frequency's sake, but about how frequency can be manipulated to optimize the application and recovery from the most important variable: volume.

### **1.2 Deconstructing "Volume": A Critical Look at How Volume is Equated in Research**

The conclusion that "all splits are equal when volume is equated" hinges entirely on the premise that volume can be, and has been, accurately equated in research settings. However, the methods used to quantify volume are not perfect, and their limitations may obscure real, practical differences between training protocols.

Historically, the most common method for quantifying and equating volume in research has been "volume load," also known as "tonnage." This is calculated by the formula: Sets×Reps×Load.12 While simple to calculate, this method is fraught with limitations that can lead to false equivalencies. For example, a powerlifting-style protocol of 7 sets of 3 repetitions (21 total reps) and a bodybuilding-style protocol of 3 sets of 10 repetitions (30 total reps) could be manipulated to have a nearly identical volume load, but they impose vastly different physiological stimuli in terms of mechanical tension, metabolic stress, and neural demand.18 The tonnage calculation fails to capture the qualitative nature of the work being done.

A more practical and physiologically relevant method for quantifying the stimulus for muscle growth is to count the number of "hard sets" performed per muscle group per week.20 A hard set is typically defined as a set performed with a high degree of effort, approaching or reaching the point of momentary muscular failure. This is often operationalized as performing sets within a specific repetition range (e.g., 6-20 repetitions) and terminating the set with a low number of Repetitions in Reserve (RIR), typically 0-3 RIR.9 This method better reflects the hypertrophic stimulus because it is the effortful repetitions at the end of a set that are thought to be most responsible for recruiting and fatiguing the full spectrum of muscle fibers, thereby triggering the signaling cascades for growth.

Even this superior method has its nuances. Sets performed with very low repetitions (e.g., fewer than 5\) appear to be less efficient for stimulating hypertrophy on a per-set basis. A landmark 2014 study by Schoenfeld and colleagues compared a bodybuilding-type routine (3 sets of 10RM) with a volume-load-equated powerlifting-type routine (7 sets of 3RM).18 Despite the powerlifting group performing more than double the number of sets, both groups experienced similar increases in biceps thickness. This indicates that a single set in the 3RM range provides a smaller hypertrophic stimulus than a single set in the 10RM range, and thus more low-rep sets are required to achieve the same growth outcome.18

This critique of volume quantification reveals a potential flaw in the overarching "volume-equated" paradigm. If the methods used to equate volume in studies comparing FB and split routines are imperfect, the conclusion of "no difference" may be an artifact of the study design rather than a reflection of physiological reality. For example, a 4-day U/L split allows for a greater variety of exercises and potentially higher intensity on any given muscle group within a session. This could lead to greater total mechanical tension or metabolic stress that is not fully captured by simply counting the number of hard sets, especially if different exercises or rep ranges are used.15 In the other direction, a 3-day FB routine often involves performing warm-up sets for the same major muscle groups three times per week, whereas a 2x/week U/L split involves only two warm-ups. One study noted that this could be considered a form of unaccounted-for volume in the FB group, which may have influenced the results.23 Therefore, the assertion that all splits are equal when volume is equated should be viewed with a degree of circumspection. The

*true* physiological stimulus delivered by each protocol may not be perfectly equivalent in these studies, and this discrepancy could explain why some well-controlled trials do, in fact, find differences between training splits.

## **Head-to-Head Evidence: Comparative Analysis of Full-Body vs. Upper/Lower Splits**

While the principle of volume primacy provides a crucial framework, the most direct insights come from studies that have explicitly compared FB and split-body training routines. This body of evidence, comprising numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and several meta-analyses, largely supports the notion of equivalence when volume is controlled. However, a closer inspection reveals important nuances and outlier results, particularly in trained populations, that challenge a simplistic interpretation and offer a more granular understanding of each protocol's unique advantages.

### **2.1 The Consensus of Equivalence: A Review of Meta-Analyses and Trials**

The highest level of evidence, the meta-analysis, consistently concludes that there is no significant difference between FB and split routines for muscle growth or strength gains when weekly training volume is held constant. A comprehensive 2024 meta-analysis by Ramos-Campo and colleagues, which synthesized the results of 14 individual studies involving 392 subjects, provides what the authors term "solid evidence" for this conclusion.2 Their pooled analysis found that the magnitude of change for both bench press strength and lower-limb strength was similar between FB and split routines. Likewise, for muscle hypertrophy, no significant between-group differences were observed for direct measures of muscle cross-sectional area in the elbow extensors, elbow flexors, or vastus lateralis, nor for indirect measures of whole-body lean mass.8

This meta-analytic conclusion is built upon a foundation of individual RCTs that report similar findings across various populations and program designs. For example, a 12-week study by Pedersen et al. (2022) randomized untrained women to either a 2-day per week FB routine or a 4-day per week U/L split, with weekly volume equated.24 After 12 weeks, both groups demonstrated substantial and statistically indistinguishable increases in 1-repetition maximum (1RM) strength in the bench press, lat pulldown, and leg press (increases of 25-30%), as well as in muscle mass (1.7-1.9%).25 Similarly, an 8-week study by Ochi et al. (2021) in untrained men compared a split routine (training muscle groups 2x/week over 4 total sessions) to a FB routine (training muscle groups 4x/week over 4 total sessions).27 Despite the vastly different frequency distributions, the equated weekly volume resulted in similar neuromuscular adaptations, with both groups showing significant gains in strength and muscle thickness with no significant differences between them.28

While the weight of this evidence is substantial, it is critical to interpret the phrase "no significant difference" with scientific precision. This is a statistical conclusion, not necessarily a declaration of absolute biological equivalence. Many individual resistance training studies are conducted with small sample sizes, which limits their statistical power—the ability to detect a true difference if one exists.5 A small but physiologically meaningful advantage for one protocol over another may fail to reach the threshold for statistical significance in an underpowered study.

This subtlety is illustrated in several key studies. Lasevicius et al. (2019) compared training muscle groups 2x/week (in a split routine) versus 3x/week (in a total-body routine) in trained men over 10 weeks.34 While they reported no statistically significant between-group differences, they astutely noted that the calculated effect sizes for

*all* hypertrophy measures (rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, and elbow extensors) favored the lower-frequency SPLIT group.34 This suggests a potential, albeit non-significant, benefit for concentrating volume into fewer, more targeted sessions for hypertrophy in this population. In a similar vein, Brigatto et al. (2022) compared 2x versus 3x weekly frequency within a split-routine framework in recreationally trained men.15 Again, no significant differences were found, but the authors highlighted that greater effect sizes for strength gains in the bench press and squat favored the higher-frequency (G3x) group.15 These patterns in effect sizes, while not statistically definitive, hint that small but potentially meaningful differences may indeed exist, which could accumulate to become significant over longer training careers. The consensus of equivalence may be more a reflection of the limitations of current research methodologies than a final verdict on the matter.

### **2.2 Examining the Outliers: When Do Full-Body and Split Routines Yield Different Results?**

While the majority of studies support equivalence, a handful of well-conducted trials have reported statistically significant differences between FB and split routines. These "outlier" studies are particularly insightful because they often involve trained participants and measure variables beyond simple strength and size, providing a window into the specific contexts where one approach may be superior to the other.

One of the most compelling studies was conducted by Bartolomei et al. in 2021, focusing specifically on a cohort of trained men—the precise demographic of interest.37 Over a 10-week period, they compared a 3-day per week FB routine against a 4-day per week split routine, with volume equated. The results were fascinatingly divergent. For maximal strength, the FB group demonstrated significantly greater improvements in isokinetic bench press strength at a slow velocity (

ISOK25). Conversely, for muscle hypertrophy, the split routine group showed significantly greater increases in vastus lateralis (a primary quadriceps muscle) thickness.37 This study is critical because it is one of the few to show a clear separation of benefits within the same cohort: the FB routine was better for upper body strength, while the split routine was better for lower body growth.

Another pivotal study by Carneiro et al. (2024) also investigated trained men, but with a focus on body composition and perceived soreness over an 8-week trial.23 They compared a 5-day FB routine to a 5-day split routine, with a high weekly volume of 75 sets equated between groups. The FB group experienced significantly greater reductions in whole-body and regional fat mass. Perhaps more strikingly, the FB group reported consistently and dramatically lower levels of Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS) across all muscle groups—up to 7.5 times lower in the lower body compared to the split group.23

These divergent findings should not be dismissed as anomalies but rather embraced as illuminating the unique strengths inherent to each training structure. The superiority of the FB routine for strength in the Bartolomei study aligns with the principle of motor learning; practicing the bench press movement pattern three times per week, as opposed to twice, likely enhanced neuromuscular efficiency and skill acquisition, which are primary drivers of strength expression, especially in complex, multi-joint lifts.5

The split routine's advantage for leg hypertrophy in the same study points to a different mechanism. A dedicated "leg day" allows a lifter to channel all their physical and mental energy into training the lower body. This focus enables higher per-session intensity, greater localized metabolic stress, and the inclusion of more total volume and exercise variety (e.g., adding leg extensions, hamstring curls, and calf raises after heavy squats) than is feasible when legs are just one component of a longer FB workout.22 This suggests that the

*quality* and *concentration* of volume on a given day may be superior in a split routine, leading to enhanced growth in large, demanding muscle groups.

Finally, the Carneiro study's findings on DOMS and fat loss reveal a profound practical advantage for the FB approach. By distributing the training stress for each muscle group across multiple sessions, no single workout is so damaging that it causes debilitating soreness. This has several downstream benefits. First, it improves quality of life and may enhance long-term adherence. Second, and more directly related to the study's findings, lower soreness can lead to higher Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT)—the calories burned from daily activities like walking, fidgeting, and taking the stairs.23 An individual who is not crippled by DOMS is more likely to be active on their "rest" days, significantly increasing their total daily energy expenditure and facilitating greater fat loss.23 This makes the FB split a potentially superior choice for individuals in a caloric deficit, those with active jobs, or anyone who finds excessive soreness to be a major barrier to training consistency.

## **Physiological Mechanisms: The "Why" Behind the Debate**

The divergent outcomes and nuanced findings in the literature comparing full-body and split routines are rooted in their differential effects on the underlying physiological mechanisms of muscle adaptation. To move beyond simply observing *what* happens and understand *why*, it is essential to explore how these training structures modulate three key processes: muscle protein synthesis (MPS), the cycle of muscle damage and repair, and the interplay between metabolic stress and fatigue.

### **3.1 The Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) Response**

The synthesis of new muscle proteins is the fundamental process driving muscle hypertrophy.40 Resistance exercise acts as a potent stimulus, transiently elevating the rate of MPS for a period following the workout. During this "anabolic window," the muscle is sensitized to nutrients and primed for growth. A key factor in this discussion is that the duration of this MPS elevation is influenced by training status. In untrained individuals, the response can last for 48 hours or more. However, in resistance-trained individuals, the body becomes more efficient, and the MPS window shortens considerably, returning to baseline levels in approximately 24-36 hours.5

This observation forms the theoretical bedrock of the pro-frequency argument. If the anabolic signal in a trained lifter effectively "shuts off" after about a day and a half, then training a muscle group only twice a week (as in a standard 4-day U/L split) leaves several days where that muscle is not in a heightened anabolic state. Proponents of higher frequency argue that a 3-day per week FB routine, by stimulating every major muscle group every other day, could keep MPS levels more consistently elevated throughout the week. This, in theory, would increase the total time spent in an anabolic state, leading to a greater cumulative accretion of muscle protein over time compared to a lower-frequency approach.30 This hypothesis is logical and has been a cornerstone of the advocacy for higher training frequencies for more than a decade.

However, the connection between acute, transient spikes in MPS and long-term, chronic hypertrophy is more complex than a simple additive model would suggest. Emerging research has begun to question whether the sum of these acute post-exercise responses is the primary determinant of growth. Some evidence suggests that adaptations in the muscle's overall capacity for protein synthesis, such as an increase in the number of ribosomes (the cellular machinery that builds proteins)—a process known as ribosome biogenesis—and long-term elevations in resting MPS, may be more important for sustained hypertrophy than the magnitude of the post-exercise spikes themselves.45 Furthermore, there may be a practical ceiling to the amount of MPS that can be stimulated in a single session. If a lifter performs an extremely high volume of work for one muscle group in a single split-routine workout, it is plausible that they reach a point of diminishing returns, where additional sets (so-called "junk volume") do not stimulate further protein synthesis and may only contribute to unnecessary fatigue and muscle damage.46

This leads to a critical evaluation of the MPS argument: while it is theoretically sound and provides a strong rationale for higher frequency training in experienced lifters, it remains practically inconclusive. The majority of longitudinal studies that have directly compared 2x versus 3x weekly training frequencies have not consistently found a significant hypertrophic advantage for the higher-frequency protocols when volume is equated (as detailed in Section 2). This discrepancy suggests that the simple MPS model is incomplete. Other factors, such as the management of muscle damage, systemic versus local fatigue, and the absolute quality of the training volume performed, are likely more rate-limiting for a trained individual than the mere frequency of the anabolic signal. The theory is elegant, but the real-world data indicates a more complex interplay of adaptive drivers.

### **3.2 Muscle Damage, Recovery, and Soreness (DOMS)**

Exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) is one of the three primary mechanisms proposed to contribute to muscle hypertrophy, alongside mechanical tension and metabolic stress.2 The micro-tears in muscle fibers that occur during strenuous exercise initiate an inflammatory and repair process that, when coupled with adequate recovery and nutrition, can lead to the muscle being rebuilt larger and stronger. However, there is a fine line between a productive level of damage that stimulates adaptation and an excessive amount that impairs recovery, hinders subsequent training performance, and compromises overall well-being.48

The structure of a training split directly influences the magnitude of EIMD and its perceptual correlate, DOMS. Split routines, which concentrate a high volume of work on a specific muscle group in a single session, are an effective way to induce significant muscle damage and are characteristically associated with higher levels of subsequent soreness.7 The classic experience of being unable to walk properly for days after a high-volume "leg day" is a testament to this effect. In contrast, FB routines distribute that same weekly volume across multiple sessions. This approach results in less damage being inflicted on any single muscle group during any given workout, leading to significantly lower levels of DOMS.23

This difference in soreness is not merely a matter of comfort; it represents a key strategic advantage of the FB training model. As demonstrated in the 2024 Carneiro et al. study, where the FB group experienced up to 7.5 times less lower-body DOMS than the split group, managing soreness has tangible benefits.23 Firstly, it dramatically improves quality of life. An individual who is not constantly battling severe muscle soreness is more likely to enjoy their training and adhere to it in the long term. Secondly, as previously mentioned, it directly impacts energy expenditure. Severe DOMS can significantly reduce a person's inclination to move, leading to a decrease in NEAT. Since NEAT can account for a substantial portion of total daily energy expenditure, maintaining higher activity levels on non-training days by minimizing soreness can be a crucial factor for individuals aiming for fat loss or improved body composition.23 Thirdly, lower systemic and local fatigue from reduced muscle damage may allow a lifter to approach each training session in a fresher state. This can improve the quality of performance not just in the next session for that muscle group, but across all training sessions throughout the week. While the body does adapt to damaging exercise via the "repeated bout effect," which lessens the soreness response over time 48, the initial and ongoing management of fatigue and soreness is a significant practical advantage of the FB approach, making it a potentially superior option for those sensitive to DOMS or whose lifestyle demands a high level of daily physical activity.

### **3.3 Metabolic Stress and Intra-Session Fatigue**

Metabolic stress refers to the buildup of metabolic byproducts, such as lactate, hydrogen ions, and inorganic phosphate, within the muscle cell as a result of training that relies heavily on anaerobic glycolysis for energy.47 This state is considered a primary driver of hypertrophy, particularly when training with moderate loads (e.g., 6-12 RM) and shorter rest periods, as it can enhance fiber recruitment, trigger anabolic hormone release, and cause cell swelling, all of which are potent hypertrophic signals.50

The choice of training split directly influences the balance between localized and systemic fatigue, and thus the nature of the metabolic stress stimulus. Split routines, by design, are exceptionally effective at generating a high degree of *localized* metabolic stress. By dedicating an entire session to one or two muscle groups, a lifter can perform a high volume of exercises with short rest intervals, creating a significant metabolic buildup and achieving the deep muscular fatigue and "pump" often associated with bodybuilding-style training.15 This concentrated onslaught is difficult to replicate for any single muscle group within a FB session.

Conversely, FB routines tend to induce greater *systemic* fatigue. A workout that includes heavy squats, followed by rows, followed by bench presses, places a substantial demand on the entire body and the central nervous system. It is a common anecdotal report, and a logical consequence of the programming, that lifters often feel their energy levels wane towards the end of a long FB session.22 This systemic drain can compromise the quality of work for muscles trained later in the workout. The last exercise in a 90-minute FB session will inevitably be performed with less intensity and focus than the first.

This reveals a fundamental trade-off dictated by the choice of split. An U/L split is superior for maximizing *per-session intensity and localized metabolic stress* on the targeted muscle groups. A lifter can approach their leg day or their upper body day feeling relatively fresh, allowing them to apply maximum effort to the task at hand. This may be particularly advantageous for bringing up lagging body parts or for advanced lifters who require an extremely potent stimulus to continue progressing. A FB routine, on the other hand, forces a strategic compromise in exercise order. Does one train legs first while fresh, but risk having less energy for upper body pressing later? Or vice versa? This challenge of managing intra-session fatigue is a key practical difference between the protocols. In essence, the U/L split prioritizes the quality of stimulus within a session, while the FB split prioritizes the frequency of stimulus and recovery between sessions.

## **The Human Factor: Adherence, Psychology, and Practicality**

While physiological mechanisms provide the scientific basis for program design, the ultimate success of any training regimen is determined not in the laboratory, but in the real world. For the vast majority of individuals, the most physiologically "optimal" program is useless if it cannot be followed consistently. Factors such as time constraints, scheduling flexibility, psychological disposition, and perceived exertion often play a more significant role in long-term adherence and, consequently, long-term results, than the subtle differences between volume-equated training splits.

### **4.1 The Logistics of Lifting: Time, Scheduling, and Flexibility**

The practical application of a training program must contend with the realities of an individual's life, including their career, family, and other commitments. The 3-day FB and 4-day U/L splits present distinct logistical profiles that may suit different lifestyles.

A 3-day FB routine requires fewer trips to the gym per week. This can be a significant advantage for individuals with limited time or those who find the commute to the gym to be a major barrier. However, the trade-off is that each individual session is necessarily longer and more systemically demanding, as a wide range of muscle groups must be trained.22 A 4-day U/L split requires a greater weekly time commitment in terms of gym visits, but each session is shorter, more focused, and potentially less psychologically daunting to begin.22

Perhaps the most significant logistical difference lies in scheduling flexibility. FB routines are inherently more forgiving. Because every muscle group is trained in every session, missing a planned workout is not catastrophic. The muscles have been stimulated recently and will be stimulated again at the next session, allowing the lifter to simply pick up where they left off.43 This adaptability is invaluable for those with unpredictable schedules. In contrast, missing a dedicated "leg day" in an U/L split can be highly disruptive. It means the lower body may go a full week or longer without direct stimulation, which can throw off the entire weekly schedule and potentially hinder progress.57

This leads to a crucial realization: the optimal split is often dictated by an individual's life constraints. For a person with a stable, predictable 9-to-5 job who can reliably commit to training on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, the U/L split is a perfectly viable and effective structure. However, for a consultant with an erratic travel schedule, a student facing final exams, or a new parent, the "plug-and-play" nature of a 3-day FB routine offers a profound practical advantage. By minimizing the negative impact of missed sessions, it increases the probability of maintaining training consistency over the long term. Since adherence is the single most important variable for achieving results, the logistical fit of a program should be a primary, not secondary, consideration.60

### **4.2 The Psychology of Progression: Self-Efficacy, Enjoyment, and Motivation**

The physiological response to training is mediated by an individual's psychological state. Motivation, enjoyment, and self-efficacy are not "soft" variables; they are powerful determinants of the effort, consistency, and longevity an individual will apply to their training program. The consensus among both researchers and experienced coaches is that the "best" program on paper is inferior to a "good enough" program that an individual genuinely enjoys and adheres to consistently.42

Self-efficacy, defined as one's belief in their ability to successfully execute a specific task, is a particularly potent predictor of exercise adherence and outcomes.61 This belief is not static; it is built and reinforced through a feedback loop of mastery experiences (successfully completing challenging workouts), vicarious experiences (seeing others succeed), social persuasion (positive feedback from coaches or peers), and positive physiological states (feeling strong and capable).61

The structure of a training split can directly influence this psychological feedback loop, shaping an individual's sense of efficacy and enjoyment in different ways. For some individuals, the U/L split may be more motivating. The focused nature of the workouts allows for a significant "pump" and a deep, localized fatigue in the target muscles. For many lifters, this sensation serves as a powerful and immediate confirmation of a "good workout," reinforcing their sense of effort and effectiveness. Furthermore, the structure of a split routine more easily accommodates a wide variety of isolation and accessory exercises, allowing the lifter to focus on "weak points" or "beach muscles," which can increase their sense of autonomy and control over their physique, thereby boosting competence and enjoyment.22

For other individuals, the FB routine may provide a more powerful psychological benefit. The higher frequency of practice on the major compound lifts (e.g., squat, bench press, deadlift) often leads to faster improvements in technique and more rapid gains in maximal strength.14 Hitting new personal records on these core lifts is a profound mastery experience and a major driver of self-efficacy. Additionally, as noted previously, the significantly lower levels of DOMS associated with FB training can increase overall enjoyment by reducing the physical discomfort and "dread" that can be associated with brutally hard training sessions.23 Personality also plays a role; some individuals may be more drawn to the variety inherent in a FB session, while others may prefer the focused, meditative nature of a split routine.65 The choice is therefore not merely logistical, but deeply personal and psychological. The optimal split is the one that provides the specific feedback loop—be it the pump, strength progression, low soreness, or variety—that an individual finds most reinforcing and motivating.

### **4.3 Perceived Exertion (RPE) and Fatigue Management**

Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) is a subjective scale used to quantify the intensity of effort during exercise. It integrates a host of physiological cues, including heart rate, breathing rate, and muscular fatigue, into a single number that represents how hard an individual feels they are working.67 In modern resistance training, RPE (often used interchangeably with RIR) is a cornerstone of autoregulation, allowing a lifter to adjust their daily training load based on their recovery and readiness, ensuring that the stimulus is challenging but manageable.

The way fatigue manifests differs between FB and split routines, which in turn affects the interpretation and application of RPE. A FB workout, by virtue of training numerous large muscle groups, induces a high degree of *systemic* fatigue. A split routine, in contrast, generates high levels of *localized* fatigue in the targeted muscles but places less demand on the system as a whole.55

This distinction has significant implications for using RPE to guide training. In a FB routine, the RPE for an exercise performed late in the session can be artificially inflated by cumulative systemic fatigue. For example, an overhead press performed after heavy squats and barbell rows might feel like an RPE 9 (one rep left in reserve), not because the deltoids and triceps are near their absolute limit, but because the lifter is generally exhausted from the preceding work. The RPE in this case reflects systemic fatigue more than local muscular effort. In an U/L split, however, the RPE for that same overhead press (performed on an upper body day) is a much "purer" measure of the targeted muscles' proximity to failure, as systemic fatigue is less of a confounding factor.

This requires different programming strategies. An RPE-based FB program must be intelligently designed to account for this effect, typically by placing the highest priority or most neurologically demanding exercises at the beginning of the session. An U/L split, on the other hand, allows for high RPEs to be achieved across all exercises for the targeted body parts, potentially leading to a greater localized stimulus if the lifter's recovery capacity can handle it. The choice of split thus influences not only how fatigue is experienced, but also how it should be measured and managed within the training program.

## **Context is King: Tailoring the Split to the Individual**

The cumulative evidence makes it clear that there is no single, universally superior training split. The choice between a 3-day FB and a 4-day U/L routine is not a matter of dogma but of context. The optimal decision is contingent upon a nuanced interplay of factors unique to the individual, including their training experience, specific goals, genetic predispositions, and practical life circumstances. The most effective program is one that is tailored to this context, acknowledging that what works best can and should evolve over a lifter's career.

### **5.1 The Lifter's Journey: Intermediate vs. Advanced Adaptations**

The relevance of the FB versus split debate intensifies as a lifter progresses beyond the beginner stage. Beginners experience rapid strength gains primarily through neural adaptations—their nervous system becomes more efficient at recruiting existing muscle fibers. They can make progress on almost any sensible program, and the specific split is of little consequence.14 For intermediate and advanced lifters, however, the "window of adaptation" narrows significantly.7 Their bodies are already accustomed to the stress of training, and further progress requires a more potent and intelligently designed stimulus.

Advanced lifters, in particular, must pursue greater training volumes and higher degrees of specialization to continue eliciting adaptation.69 This necessity often pushes them toward split routines. As an individual becomes stronger, the systemic fatigue generated by performing multiple heavy, compound lifts in a single FB session can become prohibitive. Squatting, bench pressing, and deadlifting heavy in the same workout is a monumental task that can compromise the quality of all subsequent work. At this stage of a lifter's journey, transitioning from a FB routine to a 4-day U/L split is a logical and often necessary evolution.16 The split structure allows them to continue increasing the volume and intensity applied to both the upper and lower body in a manageable way. It provides the focus needed to break through the plateaus that a less specialized FB routine may no longer be able to overcome.

This suggests that the optimal split is not static but should change as a lifter advances. An intermediate lifter might achieve their best results with a 3-day FB routine, benefiting from the high-frequency neural stimulation and efficient recovery. As they progress to an advanced level over several years, that same routine may become a bottleneck. The U/L split then becomes the superior tool, not because it is inherently better, but because it better accommodates the increased demands of an advanced athlete.

### **5.2 The Genetic Lottery: Individual Variability and the "Non-Responder"**

A consistent and humbling finding in exercise science is the vast range of individual responses to a standardized training program. When a group of people follows the exact same protocol, some will experience dramatic gains in muscle and strength ("high responders"), while others will see very modest or even negligible results ("low responders").72 This variability is heavily influenced by an individual's genetic makeup.

Factors such as heritable muscle fiber type composition play a significant role. An individual with a naturally higher percentage of fast-twitch (Type II) muscle fibers may respond more favorably to high-intensity, low-repetition training, whereas someone with a predominance of slow-twitch (Type I) fibers might be better suited for higher-repetition, endurance-oriented work.72 These genetic predispositions likely influence not only the hypertrophic response but also recovery capacity and tolerance for different training frequencies and volumes.77

Direct evidence for this comes from studies using within-subject designs, where each leg of a participant is trained with a different protocol. These studies have shown that, even with total volume equated, some individuals achieve greater muscle growth with a high-frequency protocol, while others respond better to a lower-frequency one.78 This demonstrates that an individual's optimal training frequency is a unique characteristic.

This reality leads to a crucial conclusion: the "best split" is genetically dependent and must ultimately be determined empirically. Science provides principles and starting points, but it cannot provide a one-size-fits-all prescription. There is no single training split that will be optimal for everyone because of the profound biological diversity among individuals. A lifter with exceptional recovery abilities might thrive on the high-frequency stimulus of a 5-day FB routine. Another lifter might find that only the focused stimulus and longer recovery periods afforded by an U/L split allow them to make consistent progress without overtraining. Therefore, the ultimate answer for any given individual cannot be found in a meta-analysis alone. It must be discovered through a process of structured self-experimentation: selecting a logically designed program, following it consistently for a dedicated training block (e.g., 8-12 weeks), meticulously tracking progress, and then objectively evaluating the results before making informed adjustments.

### **5.3 Specificity of Sport: Bodybuilding vs. Powerlifting**

The principle of specificity dictates that training adaptations are specific to the stimulus applied. Therefore, the optimal training split is also a function of the specific demands of an individual's training goal, most clearly illustrated by the differing needs of competitive powerlifters and bodybuilders.

For a powerlifter, the primary objective is to maximize 1RM strength in three specific movements: the squat, bench press, and deadlift. Success in this sport is heavily dependent on neuromuscular efficiency and technical mastery of these lifts. Consequently, training programs that allow for high-frequency practice of the competition lifts are often favored. A 3-day FB routine is an excellent template for this, as it can be structured to include some variation of the squat, bench press, and deadlift in every session, maximizing motor learning.79 An U/L split can also be highly effective for powerlifting, but it is typically structured to maintain high frequency on the most neurologically complex or recovery-intensive lift. For example, a common powerlifting U/L split might feature squats on one lower body day and deadlifts on the other, while including a bench press variation on

*both* upper body days to achieve a 2x/week frequency for all three lifts.

For a bodybuilder, the primary objective is to achieve maximal, symmetrical muscle hypertrophy across the entire physique. This requires not only developing the large prime movers but also ensuring sufficient training volume for smaller, aesthetic-focused muscle groups like the side deltoids, biceps, triceps, and calves. These smaller muscles may not receive an optimal growth stimulus from a program built exclusively around the three powerlifts.64 Here, U/L and other body-part splits often prove superior. They provide the dedicated time and energy required to perform the necessary accessory and isolation exercises to ensure that no muscle group is left behind. A bodybuilder can dedicate specific portions of their upper and lower body days to directly targeting these smaller muscles after the main compound work is complete, a task that is difficult to manage in an already-crowded FB session.

The choice of split, therefore, directly reflects the specific demands of the goal. Powerlifting is a skill-based strength sport, and its training prioritizes the frequency of skill practice. Bodybuilding is an aesthetic pursuit focused on muscle volume, and its training prioritizes the ability to apply targeted volume to every muscle. The debate between FB and U/L splits can thus be viewed as a strategic choice between prioritizing movement pattern frequency versus ensuring comprehensive, muscle-specific volume.

## **Synthesis and Actionable Recommendations for the Trained Male**

The extensive body of scientific evidence and practical considerations reveals that the choice between a 3-day full-body routine and a 4-day upper/lower split is not a matter of one being definitively superior, but rather a strategic decision based on an individual's goals, training status, lifestyle, and psychological preferences. When weekly training volume is equated, the differences in strength and hypertrophy outcomes are often small and statistically non-significant. However, nuanced advantages for each approach emerge under specific conditions, and the most important factor for long-term success remains adherence.

### **6.1 Final Verdict: A Synthesized Comparison**

* **For Lean Mass Gains (Hypertrophy):** The evidence largely indicates **no significant difference** between the two splits when weekly volume is equated.2 However, a 4-day U/L split may offer a slight practical edge for intermediate to advanced lifters seeking to maximize growth in specific, stubborn body parts (such as the legs), as it allows for greater per-session volume and localized metabolic stress.37 Conversely, a 3-day FB split may be marginally superior for improving overall body composition (i.e., gaining muscle while losing fat), as the associated lower levels of DOMS can lead to higher non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) and greater total daily energy expenditure.23  
  * **Verdict: Largely a tie. The optimal choice is context-dependent, with U/L favoring focused volume and FB favoring systemic recovery and activity levels.**  
* **For Strength Gains:** The data again shows **no significant difference** when volume is equated.2 However, there is a strong theoretical rationale and some direct evidence to suggest that a 3-day FB split may hold an advantage for expressing maximal strength in complex, multi-joint lifts like the bench press.37 This is attributed to the higher frequency of practice, which enhances motor learning and neuromuscular efficiency.5  
  * **Verdict: A slight potential edge to Full-Body for optimizing neuromuscular skill and strength expression in the primary compound movements.**  
* **For Adherence:** This is the most critical and highly individual variable. A 3-day FB routine offers unparalleled **flexibility**, making it ideal for individuals with busy or unpredictable schedules, as missing a day is less disruptive to the overall weekly plan.43 A 4-day U/L split offers  
  **shorter, more focused sessions**, which some individuals may find more mentally manageable and motivating. It also allows for a greater feeling of a "pump" and localized fatigue, which can be psychologically rewarding.22  
  * **Verdict: Entirely dependent on the individual's schedule, psychological preferences, and lifestyle constraints. The most adherent program is the best program.**

### **6.2 A Decision-Making Framework: How to Choose Your Optimal Split**

To translate this analysis into a practical tool, the following framework can help a trained male lifter determine which split is likely the better starting point for his specific context.

#### **Table 2: Decision-Making Matrix: 3-Day Full-Body vs. 4-Day Upper/Lower**

| Consideration | Choose 3-Day Full-Body If... | Choose 4-Day Upper/Lower If... |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Primary Goal** | Your primary goal is **maximal strength** in compound lifts (e.g., powerlifting focus), and you want to maximize motor learning through frequent practice.37 | Your primary goal is **maximal hypertrophy** for all body parts, and you want to dedicate focused time and volume to each muscle group, including smaller ones.37 |
| **Training Age** | You are an **intermediate** lifter who can still make progress on compound lifts without accumulating excessive fatigue from a single session.69 | You are an **advanced** lifter whose strength levels make it prohibitively fatiguing to train heavy compound lifts together, and you require higher specialization and volume to progress.70 |
| **Time Availability** | You have a limited number of days you can train per week (2-3) and prefer **fewer, longer** training sessions.22 | You can consistently commit to **4 training days per week** and prefer shorter, more frequent sessions.22 |
| **Scheduling Flexibility** | Your schedule is **unpredictable** (e.g., travel, demanding job, family commitments). The FB routine is more forgiving if you miss a planned workout.43 | Your schedule is **stable and predictable**, and you can reliably hit your four designated training days each week.57 |
| **Psychological Preference** | You are motivated by **strength PRs** and enjoy the feeling of being athletic and functional. You prefer variety within each workout.14 | You are motivated by the **"pump"** and feeling of localized muscular fatigue. You enjoy focusing intensely on one or two body parts at a time.22 |
| **Sensitivity to Soreness** | You are sensitive to **DOMS**, or it negatively impacts your job, sport, or quality of life. The FB split significantly reduces soreness.23 | You tolerate DOMS well or even enjoy the sensation as a marker of a hard workout. You can manage the recovery from high-volume, targeted sessions.7 |

### **6.3 Sample Evidence-Based Programs**

The following sample programs are designed for a trained male lifter, incorporating the principles discussed. They serve as templates that should be customized based on individual recovery, equipment access, and specific goals. The key is consistent application of progressive overload—striving to add a small amount of weight or an extra repetition over time.
