## Understanding the Foundations and Failures of Insurance Systems
### Yale Financial Market Coursea Lesson 3 Notes

The theoretical foundation of insurance lies in risk pooling—the idea that individual risks are shared across a large population. This principle is grounded in the Law of Large Numbers, which states that as the number of trials increases, the mean outcome converges toward an real expected value, and the standard deviation converges to 0. In other words, while it is uncertain whether any one individual will experience a loss, the overall proportion of people who do becomes highly predictable. This statistical reliability is what enables insurance companies to operate sustainably. 

However, this balance can be disrupted by two major challenges: moral hazard and selection bias.
Moral hazard arises when insured individuals alter their behavior because they are protected against loss—for example, deliberately burning your own house to claim insurance, or allowing yourself to be underproductive with farming due to the safety net of crop insurance. One solution is to shift to mechanisms that cannot be manipulated by human behavior, such as replacing crop insurance with weather insurance, though these bring their own challenges. Fundamentally speaking, Insurance can only be provided for uncertain loss. You can't insure un-risk.

Selection bias, on the other hand, occurs when the group purchasing insurance is not representative of the expected insured population, leading to mispriced risk. For example, if only sick individuals sign up for health insurance, premiums must rise to cover the higher claim rate. This can turn into a death spiral, where rising costs drive out healthy policyholders as it becomes no longer cost-effective for them. Governments address this through testing like medical exams and by making the insurance mandatory, to achieve a balanced risk pool.

To deal with cases where insurance companies go out of business, insurance guarantee funds were introduced in recent decades. These are essentially insurance for insurance—state-established safety nets that pay claims even when an insurer goes bankrupt. Before these funds existed, policyholders simply lost their coverage and money if their insurer collapsed. Insurance regulation was historically fragmented at the state level, which led to chaos and inconsistency. The creation of national coordinating bodies like the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) helped achieve regulatory coordination.

Health insurance is complicated. Before modern health plans, medical services were provided to uninsured individuals on a fee-for-service basis by practitioners. This was problematic because doctors had no incentive to keep people healthy—they earned more money when people were sick.  This changed with the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973, which required employers to offer federally certified health plans. These plans also encouraged regular check-ups and paid doctors a fixed salary instead of fees per procedure. Later, the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare)  made health insurance mandatory, fining those who did not participate. However, this allowed a core issue to persist in the U.S.: most health insurance is privately owned and tied to employment. When individuals lose their jobs, they often have to pay higher premiums for health plans in the individual market, especially if they are evaluated as highly likely to be sick. 

Another domain filled with challenges is disaster insurance, which includes coverage for risks such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, and terrorism. Many failures in this space have been documented. For instance, after Hurricane Katrina, some insurers denied claims by claiming that the homes were destroyed by flooding (which required separate coverage that most families didn't have), rather than by the hurricane itself. Similarly, in Haiti, a lack of trust in insurers left many people uninsured when a devastating earthquake hit. Terrorism risk was not even a thing before 911, after which insurers wanted to exclude it from coverage. In response, the U.S. government passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA), which required insurers to provide terrorism coverage, initially for three years. Due to the ongoing need, the act has been renewed multiple times and is likely to be made permanent in the future.
