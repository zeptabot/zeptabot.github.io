# Understanding Foreign Key Constraints in PostgreSQL

When you add a foreign key constraint in PostgreSQL, it enforces referential integrity between tables, which changes what operations you can perform on the related columns. Letâ€™s explore this with an example.

## The Scenario

You executed the following command:

ALTER TABLE order_details
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_order_details
FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id);

This means `order_details.order_id` must always correspond to a valid `orders.order_id`.

---

## What This Means for `orders.order_id`

- **Cannot delete** a row in `orders` if its `order_id` is referenced in `order_details` (unless you use ON DELETE CASCADE).
- **Cannot update** `orders.order_id` to a new value if it breaks the foreign key relationship (unless ON UPDATE CASCADE is specified).
- **Cannot drop or alter** the `orders.order_id` column in ways that break the foreign key without first removing the constraint.

---

## What This Means for `order_details.order_id`

- **Cannot insert** values that do not exist in `orders.order_id`.
- **Cannot update** `order_details.order_id` to a value that does not exist in `orders.order_id`.
- **Cannot drop or alter** `order_details.order_id` column without dropping the foreign key constraint first.

## Summary Table

| Action                     | On orders.order_id                | On order_details.order_id            |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Delete referenced row      | Not allowed without CASCADE      | N/A                                |
| Update referenced key      | Restricted                      | Restricted                         |
| Insert invalid reference   | N/A                             | Not allowed                       |
| Update to invalid reference| N/A                             | Not allowed                       |
| Drop/modify column type    | Restricted                      | Restricted                        |

## How to Check Existing Foreign Keys

Use this query to list foreign keys on a table:

SELECT
  conname,
  conrelid::regclass AS table,
  pg_get_constraintdef(oid) AS definition
FROM pg_constraint
WHERE conrelid = 'order_details'::regclass AND contype = 'f';

---

## How to Remove the Foreign Key Constraint

To drop the foreign key:

ALTER TABLE order_details DROP CONSTRAINT fk_order_details;

---

## Conclusion

Adding a foreign key is a powerful way to ensure data integrity but it comes with restrictions on deleting, updating, or modifying columns involved. Always plan these constraints according to your application logic.

If you want to manage or troubleshoot these constraints, knowing the impact on the involved tables is crucial.
