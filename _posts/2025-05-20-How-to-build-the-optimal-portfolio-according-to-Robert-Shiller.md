# How to build the optimal portfolio, according to Robert Shiller

## Yale Financial Market Coursea Lesson 4 Notes
As individual investors, our primary focus should be on the overall mean return and variance of our entire portfolio, rather than the performance of any single asset. When evaluating an asset, we should consider how it impacts the risk and variance of our whole portfolio, which then helps us decide how much to invest in it. A fundamental principle in investing is diversification – avoiding "putting all your eggs in one basket" – as it helps reduce systematic risk.

### The World of Hedge Funds: High Stakes, High Risk
Hedge funds are a unique type of investment company not openly available to the general public. They can only be promoted through private conversations, and typically only experienced investors qualify to participate. These funds employ large teams of financial analysts and engage in sophisticated, often risky, investment strategies.

However, The huge systematic risk (risk that leads to the crash of entire markets due to the interconnectedness of financial institutions) they take could also be a huge problem, as evidenced by the 2008 crisis. After the crisis, society became much more aware of the systematic risk imposed by such hedge funds and took more proactive, macro-level measures to regulate it, like stress tests.

However, the regulations are inherently flawed, as they could never accurately model the probability of "Black-Swan" (low probability but catastrophic once it happens) events due to a lack of data on such events, which in turn is due to their low-probabilistic nature. The classic example being the 2008 crisis itself.

### Mitigating Labor Market Risk: Unemployment Insurance
Unemployment insurance emerged in 1911 as a way to manage labor market risk, providing financial assistance to laid-off individuals and helping them find new jobs in the short term. More recently, due to growing socioeconomic inequality, people like President Obama proposed expanding this insurance. The idea that such insurance could be claimed by people who had to take really bad, undesirable jobs (like minimum wage ones) due to losing their previous job and failing to find alternatives, as well as making it a government insurance. However, this idea has not been carried out.

### CAPM: the Optimal Portfolio
The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) helps determine the optimal portfolio an investor can hold, with diversification being the key. Ideally, you want to diversify across a wide spectrum of investments, from those with the lowest risk and return to those with the highest (as risk is generally positively associated with potential returns).

There's some debate, though, about whether maximum diversification is always the smartest approach. For instance, between 1802 and 2012, the U.S. stock market outperformed short-term government bonds by almost 4% annually – a phenomenon known as the equity premium puzzle. However, this trend isn't necessarily universal, Since capitalism in other countries may not be as successful as in the States, due to less stable political and economic environments.

It's also uncertain whether past returns actually predict future trends. While you can reasonably expect utility companies to remain stable, safe, low-risk, and low-return assets for the foreseeable future, the same can't be said for highly innovative companies like Apple and Meta. Too many unknowns are involved. This is similar to the excitement surrounding electricity in the 1920s: electricity stocks saw both incredible returns and significant crashes during the Depression.

### Beta in CAPM: Understanding Asset Sensitivity
In CAPM, both positive beta (including high beta) and negative beta assets offer unique value. While high positive beta stocks, like Apple, bring in high returns when the economy is thriving, Negative beta assets, such as gold, can provide a buffer and protection against market shocks like a recession.

The CAPM model's equation for expected return establishes a linear relationship between an asset's expected return and the difference between the market return and the risk-free return. The direction and magnitude of this relationship are determined by the asset's beta, with the risk-free return acting as the baseline (alpha). However, this model relies on the assumption that everyone holds the same diversified, optimal portfolio, which isn't true in reality. Therefore, it is inherently limited in applicability.

### The Paradox of Short Selling in CAPM
Short selling is a strategy to profit from an anticipated decline in a stock's price. You borrow shares of a stock you expect to fall, sell them, buy them back at a lower price when they do fall, and then return the borrowed shares.  It could represented by holding a negative quantity of a stock. 

While short selling is legal (though heavily regulated) in the real world, it's theoretically impossible for a stock to have a negative optimal holding quantity in CAPM. This is because CAPM assumes everyone holds the same portfolio; if everyone were shorting a stock (holding a negative quantity), there would be no one to provide the stock to short (holding a positive quantity), creating a paradoxical disequilibrium.

### Optimizing Your Portfolio: Variance and Returns
According to CAPM, an optimal portfolio should aim to reduce its variance. We achieve this by selecting assets with low covariance. Theoretically, you could construct a portfolio to achieve any desired expected return, but this often means taking on an extremely high risk (variance), making that expected return practically unachievable.

The relationship between standard deviation (risk) and expected return isn't strictly linear. At the lower end of the graph, near the origin, standard deviation can actually decrease as expected return increases. This happens as you diversify your portfolio from investing in a single asset (for example, by adding stocks and oil to a 100% bond portfolio). However, this efficiency eventually peaks, and the relationship then becomes positive. The risk-to-expected-return ratio is heavily influenced by your portfolio's composition. Ultimately, the choice of an "efficient frontier" depends on your individual preference for different levels of risk in light of different potential returns.

### The Gordon Growth Model: evaluating Assets with Constant Growth
For assets with a theoretically constant growth rate (g) whose value would grow infinitely (X(1+g) with X being the value at time 1), the present value (value at time 0) can be determined using the Gordon Growth Model. According to this model, buying a stock in a declining industry isn't necessarily a bad investment. As long as you purchase an asset below its present value, calculated by the formula, it's considered a good investment, and vice versa.

For example, though it sounds counterintuitive, it was smart to buy railroad stocks in the late 1990s during the height of the dot-com bubble, and also when commercial airlines first became hyped. These were times when railroads were overlooked by the public and thus underpriced. The present value formula involves the value at time 1 divided by (r−g), where r is the "required return rate." This rate is positively associated with both the risk-free interest rate and systematic risk. Therefore, a higher systematic risk and/or risk-free interest rate will lead to a lower present value.
