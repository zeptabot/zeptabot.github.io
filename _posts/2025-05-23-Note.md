## Yale Financial Market Coursea Lesson 2 Notes


**Value at Risk (VaR)**, with a lowercase "a," is a financial metric that emerged after the **1987 stock market crash**. It estimates the probability of an asset losing a specific amount of value over a given time period. For example, a **1% one-year VaR of $1,000** means there is a **1% chance** the asset will lose at least $1,000 in value within a year.  

A **stress test**, on the other hand, evaluates a firm’s financial resilience under various hypothetical crisis scenarios. Stress tests look over the entire portfolio of the firm (including interconnections with other institutions, ownings, etc.) and analyze the impact of extreme events—such as a severe recession or a sharp currency depreciation. Importantly, stress tests do not rely primarily on historical returns.  

The **Dodd-Frank Act of 2010** mandated annual stress tests for non-bank financial institutions, requiring them to assess their stability under **three unspecified crisis scenarios**. However, critics argue that stress tests have significant limitations:  

1. **They may underestimate worst-case scenarios.** For instance, a firm might pass a stress test simulating a **13% price drop** but fail in reality if prices plunge by **30%**—a situation that has occurred in the past.  
2. **Firms may conceal unfavorable results** to protect their reputation, making regulatory oversight an ongoing challenge.  

### Interdependence in the Stock Market  
The **Law of Large Numbers does not apply to the U.S. stock market** because stock prices are **highly correlated**. If stocks moved independently, the **S&P 500** would exhibit much smoother trends. Instead, its volatility from **2000 to 2014** demonstrates that when the market performs well, most stocks tend to rise, and vice versa.  

### Measuring Risk: Beta and Covariance  
A stock’s sensitivity to market movements is captured by its **beta ($\beta$)** in a regression model. For example, if we regress **Apple’s monthly returns** against the **S&P 500’s returns**, we find a slope ($\beta$) of **1.75**. This means:  
- **$\beta > 0$** → Apple’s performance is **positively correlated** with the market.  
- **$\beta > 1$** → Apple **overreacts** to market changes, indicating **high systematic (market) risk**.  

Risk can be decomposed into:  
1. **Systematic risk (market risk)** – Fluctuations tied to the broader market (captured by $\beta$).  
2. **Idiosyncratic risk** – Firm-specific fluctuations (e.g., Apple’s stock reaction to Steve Jobs’ death), captured by the **variance of regression residuals**.  

Mathematically:  
$$  
\text{Var}(Y) = \beta^2 \cdot \text{Var}(X) + \text{Var}(\text{residuals})  
$$  

This behavior can be further modeled by covariance, which is the tendency for two random variables to move together. Higher covariance means higher risk. When one diversifies their portfolio, they should ideally minimize the covariance between different stocks, as this would minimize the idiosyncratic risk. In reality, this is not possible. Even in mutual funds, there is still a world market risk.

### Fat Tails in Financial Returns  
It's worth noting that while most random variables in nature follow the normal distribution, this is not the case for financial returns such as stock price changes. Instead, they follow a Cauchy distribution, which has a "fat tail" compared to the normal distribution, making it much more likely to observe outliers when drawing samples (or observing outcomes). This can be seen in the empirical data of the S&P500 price changes from 1928 to 2014, which contains one extreme rise of around 10% and one extreme drop of around 20%. In the normal distribution, the probability of observing such events is essentially ZERO (a vanishingly small probability). Thus, it is evident that stock price changes do not follow the normal distribution.
