# Could Psilocybin Treat Eating Disorders?

A mainstream hallucinogen extracted from magic mushrooms — Psilocybin — is now being researched by the scientific community to see if it can help treat eating disorders!

Scientists are eyeing magic mushrooms (specifically psilocybin) because it could assist eating disorder patients on multiple levels:

- **Improving Body Image Perception**: Eating disorder patients often have distorted body image beliefs. Psilocybin may help temporarily dissolve the "self"—and inherent perceptions of the body—making these rigid beliefs more flexible. It can weaken the influence of "higher-order prior beliefs," allowing the brain to update its view of the body based on new information [Calder et al., 2023].
- **Regulating Reward Processing Mechanisms**: The reward systems in eating disorder patients are often dysregulated [Avena & Bocarsly, 2012; Bohon & Stice, 2011]. Psilocybin is thought to help restore responses to natural reward stimuli and combat anhedonia [Calder et al., 2023]. It can weaken the influence of "higher-order prior beliefs," allowing the brain to update judgments about "what is beneficial" or "what is harmful" based on new information [Calder et al., 2023].
- **Enhancing Cognitive Flexibility**: Psilocybin is believed to help break rigid thinking and behavioral patterns, making them more plastic and improving cognitive flexibility [Borgland & Neyens, 2022; Brouwer & Carhart-Harris, 2021; Miles et al., 2020].
- **Promoting Trauma Processing**: Many eating disorder patients have trauma histories [Backholm et al., 2013; Dansky et al., 1997; Dubosc et al., 2012; Molendijk et al., 2017; Rijkers et al., 2019]. Psilocybin-assisted therapy can facilitate trauma processing, helping patients confront and address previously insurmountable psychological barriers [Brewerton et al., 2022; Calder et al., 2023; Mitchell et al., 2021b; Mithoefer et al., 2011].
- **Increasing Brain Connectivity**: Studies show that psilocybin can significantly enhance functional connectivity between different brain regions, allowing areas that don't usually "communicate" to interact [Borgland & Neyens, 2022]. This "connectivity explosion" state is said to persist for some time after the drug wears off, promoting neuroplasticity (the brain's ability to "reprogram" itself) [Roseman et al., 2019]. This rewiring may help people break free from old, ineffective, or even destructive thinking and emotional patterns [Zeifman et al., 2020]. It can also promote the growth of new neural connections, particularly increasing dendrites and dendritic spines; these changes can last at least a month [Shao et al., 2021].
- **Regulating Gut Microbiota**: Some research suggests that psilocybin may exert long-term effects by influencing the gut microbiota, increasing microbial diversity in mice, which could aid recovery from eating disorders and comorbid mood disorders [Cordner et al., 2022; Kelly et al., 2023].
  

## Research on psilocybin for treating eating disorders is still in a very early stage, but there are encouraging signs.

- **Preliminary Evidence and Case Reports**:
  - A few studies and case reports show that psilocybin-assisted treatment may be effective for **anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN)** [Peck et al., 2023; Rodan et al., 2025].
  - A 1959 case study (translated in 2021) reported that a 35-year-old woman with anorexia nervosa experienced immediate and lasting mood improvements after a psilocybin injection, along with weight gain and new insights into the psychological roots of her condition [Delay et al., 1959; Verroust et al., 2021].
  - An open-label feasibility study with 10 women with anorexia nervosa showed that 25 mg of psilocybin, combined with psychological support, was **safe and well-tolerated** [Peck et al., 2023; Spriggs et al., 2021]. These women had significantly reduced weight concerns at 1 and 3 months post-treatment, and shape concerns decreased at 1 month [Peck et al., 2023]. Participants also showed significant improvements in depression and well-being scores after treatment [Peck et al., 2023; Spriggs et al., 2021].
  - Other research has found psilocybin use associated with positive improvements in depression and well-being scores [Roseman et al., 2018; Spriggs et al., 2021].
  - Preliminary studies also indicate that psychedelics may promote psychological breakthroughs, helping patients evaluate their thoughts and behaviors [Peck et al., 2023; Peill et al., 2022; Roseman et al., 2019].

- **Initial Safety Exploration**:
  - In these early studies, psilocybin appears **safe and well-tolerated**, with side effects usually **mild and transient**, such as headaches, fatigue, and nausea [Coppola et al., 2022; Peck et al., 2023; Spriggs et al., 2021].
  - Notably, in studies with anorexia nervosa patients, cases of **hypoglycemia** occurred, suggesting the need for close blood sugar monitoring in the future [Coppola et al., 2022; Peck et al., 2023; Scolnick et al., 2020].
  - Current research has not found increases in suicidal ideation [Peck et al., 2023].
  - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has designated psilocybin as a "breakthrough therapy," further affirming its safety [Kato et al., 2025]. However, psilocybin remains a **federal Schedule I controlled substance** in the U.S., with research progress limited by regulatory barriers and limited federal funding [Barnett et al., 2022; Hall, 2021; Huberman, 2023a; Johnson et al., 2008; Johnson et al., 2018; Kato et al., 2025; Xi et al., 2023].

- **Many Clinical Trials on the Way**:
  - Globally, there are currently **6 registered** clinical trials of psilocybin for eating disorders, with 5 targeting anorexia nervosa and 1 for binge eating disorder (BED) [Bevione et al., 2025; Rodan et al., 2025]. Most were registered after 2020, indicating rapid development in this field [Bevione et al., 2025].
  - One is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing 25 mg psilocybin to 1 mg psilocybin (control group) to evaluate safety and efficacy in anorexia nervosa [Bevione et al., 2025; Carhart-Harris et al., 2021].
  - Another study is exploring psilocybin in young adults with anorexia nervosa, involving doses of 20 mg and 30 mg [Bevione et al., 2025].
    

## Practical tips

- **Doses Make a Big Difference**: What we often hear about as "microdosing" refers to sub-perceptual doses where you barely feel the psychoactive effects, typically 1-3 mg pure psilocybin or 0.1-0.5 g dried mushrooms. In contrast, clinical studies use **"macrodosing"**, which can induce strong psychedelic experiences, like **25 mg pure psilocybin**. Current research shows that macrodosing, under **professional supervision**, demonstrates more significant therapeutic effects [Carbonaro et al., 2016; Goodwin et al., 2022; Roseman et al., 2018; Szigeti et al., 2024]. Evidence for microdosing's efficacy is currently **very limited and mixed**, with some studies suggesting it may have no effect [Carhart-Harris et al., 2021; Cavanna et al., 2022; Murphy et al., 2023; Rootman et al., 2021; Szigeti & Heifets, 2024; Szigeti et al., 2024; van Elk & Fried, 2023].
- **Set and Setting Are Crucial**: These successful clinical trials aren't just done casually at home! They emphasize the importance of "set and setting," including:
  - **Professional Guidance**: Experienced therapists provide full accompaniment, offering psychological support and integration therapy [Breeksema et al., 2020; Brewerton et al., 2022; Calder et al., 2023; Carhart-Harris & Friston, 2019; Carhart-Harris et al., 2016; Carhart-Harris et al., 2021; Gukasyan et al., 2022; Garcia-Romeu et al., 2014; Griffiths et al., 2006; Griffiths et al., 2011; Griffiths et al., 2018; Hasler, 2022; Johnson et al., 2008; Johnson et al., 2019; Vollenweider & Preller, 2020; Watts et al., 2017; Zeifman et al., 2020].
  - **Comfortable and Safe Environment**: Usually a cozy room, sometimes with soothing music and eye masks to help patients focus on inner experiences [Calder et al., 2023; Holze et al., 2022b; Johnson et al., 2008; Mithoefer et al., 2011; Mithoefer et al., 2019].
  - **"Let Go" Mindset**: Patients are encouraged to release resistance and allow the experience to guide them in exploring their inner depths [Bogenschutz et al., 2015; Bogenschutz et al., 2022; Brouwer & Carhart-Harris, 2021; Carbonaro et al., 2016; Carhart-Harris & Friston, 2019; Carhart-Harris et al., 2016; Carhart-Harris et al., 2021; Garcia-Romeu et al., 2014; Griffiths et al., 2006; Hasler, 2022; Huberman, 2023a; Johnson et al., 2008; Johnson et al., 2017; Müller et al., 2025; Roseman et al., 2018; Vollenweider & Preller, 2020; Watts et al., 2017; Zeifman et al., 2020].
  - **Fasting Beforehand**: It's usually recommended to fast for at least four hours before taking psilocybin.
- **Safety First—All Medicines Have Risks**:
  - **Hallucinogenic Risks**: "Bad trips" can occur, leading to fear, paranoia, and other negative experiences [Carbonaro et al., 2016].
  - **Mental Health Risks**: People with a history of mental illness (like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder) or family history may trigger or worsen psychotic episodes [Hall, 2021].
  - **Cardiovascular Risks**: While side effects in early studies are mild, theoretically, long-term high-frequency use could pose risks of cardiac fibrosis [Rouaud et al., 2024].
  - **Illegality and Purity Issues**: Psilocybin is still a **federal Schedule I controlled substance** in the U.S., and **illegal possession and sale are serious crimes** [Xi et al., 2023]. Street-sourced magic mushrooms or "recreational drugs" carry extremely high risks of being laced with deadly substances like fentanyl [Huberman, 2023].


## Outlook

Although research on psychedelics (like psilocybin) for treating eating disorders is still in the early exploration phase, its initial results undoubtedly bring new hope to patients who haven't responded well to traditional therapies. As more rigorous clinical trial data accumulates, we have reason to hold a cautious yet optimistic view of the future potential of psychedelic-assisted therapy [Peck et al., 2023; Rodan et al., 2025; Solmi et al., 2024]. This could not only revolutionize treatment paradigms for eating disorders and other mental illnesses but also hopefully help people break the stereotype that psychedelics = drugs, ultimately providing healing opportunities for more patients suffering from these conditions [Brouwer & Carhart-Harris, 2021; Longo et al., 2020; Madras, 2022; Panero et al., 2022].
