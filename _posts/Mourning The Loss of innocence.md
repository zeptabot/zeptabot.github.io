Hey guys, so today I want to talk about grieving the loss of your innocence.

I'm a university student, and I've been feeling lost and overwhelmed trying to navigate the adult world. My core struggle is dealing with the fact that people live in completely different, almost alien, realities.

For example, I'll listen to a podcast about a grad student who applied to over 140 internships and only got two offers, and I feel the intense anxiety and pressure of the professional grind. Then, minutes later, I'll hear an interview with an artist talking about how a one-night stand unlocked a new understanding of intimacy and inspired their album.

Hearing these two stories back-to-back creates a really bitter and painful feeling in me. It's not jealousy, exactly, but a deep confusion about how these worlds can even exist at the same time. One reality is about an intense struggle for survival and career stability—grinding LeetCode for over 10 hours a day, being completely burnt out, and wanting to kill themself. Meanwhile someone has a one-night stand and spends so much cognitive resources on a deep, intellectual reflection about how that experience refreshes their understanding of self-identity and human intimacy. A story seems completely disconnected from that struggle.

This is just an example of what my brain is primed to think these days. Comparing these two narratives makes me question my own place in the world:

Do I deserve to pursue my own dreams, or is that just a childish fantasy? Should my primary focus be on practicality and survival? How much of the answer to 'Do you get to choose?' is determined by your social class, and how much is just a matter of mindset or the 'headspace' you live in?

And the truth is, I've known the answer all along; I've just been unable to face it. I've been escaping the answer that it's almost entirely determined by your financial situation, which is not fair and never will be. Only a very few privileged people in history get to experience anything similar to what that artist did.

And of the vast, complex, and beautiful ocean of human experiences that I stumbled upon when I was young—through books, media, but mostly on the internet—I realize 99% of them are going to be inaccessible to me. That includes the different personalities and identities one could be, like a drag queen, a waacker, a voguer, a park ranger, a humanist photographer, a survivalist like Edward Stafford... I'm not going to be those things in 20 years, and possibly not ever.

So as I'm maturing and fully realizing the gravity of real-world constraints, I kind of want to cry. I did cry about this the other day. I just feel like something inside me has died. And I guess that's what people call your innocence. So if I'm going to summarize my feelings into one sentence, it's that I'm grieving. Grieving the loss of my innocence, the loss of the worlds I thought I could be a part of, the people I thought I could be, and the truth I thought I had in my hand. It's gone. Just gone.

And I can't really share this with anyone because probably nobody in my social circle would be empathetic toward this situation. Take my parents, for example. They have lived in the real world their entire lives, constantly fighting for stability before eventually building their careers and making their fortunes. They would never resonate with this feeling, or even respect it. And I fully understand that. If I were them, I would judge it. I would think it's pathetic.

The problem isn't that I'm losing my ignorance. The problem is that I was ever detached from the real world in the first place—that I consumed so much unrealistic pop culture as a kid, and that my spoiled, middle-class ass had spent the first 18 years of my life in that bubble.

So no, nobody's going to empathize with that. I'm grieving for my change, and it's a phase I have to go through alone. As much as I would like it to stop and focus on school, focus on getting a job, I know just suppressing those emotions is not healthy or sustainable. So this video is a way of recording those feelings. And I'm putting this out here in case someone is going through the same thing and comes across this video. Well, I'd like you to know that you're not alone, and it's okay to feel this way. Think of it as the actual rest of your life has just opened up in front of you, and it's going to be a hell of a journey, that's for sure.

As for practical next steps, I need to go on an information diet. Stop with the podcasts, the social media posts, just focus on school, run, lift, meditate, gratitude journaling, and read some books that actually help you understand the world and make better decisions, like 'Sapiens', 'The Psychology of Money', etc.

And yeah, that's it.
